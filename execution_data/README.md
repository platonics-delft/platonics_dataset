The .pkl files contain dictionaries with lists of the messages received during each of the trials, where 'pose' contains the recorded poses, 'goal' contains each of the goals sent to the robot, 'wrench' contains the measured forces and torques, and 'joint' contains the joint states. 

The .csv files contain the same data, but converted into time series, where we also separated the poses into position and orientation, and the forces and torques into each of their components. 

We also include the python script we used to convert the .pkl files.
