# Platonics Dataset

This repository stores trajectories, templates and execution-logs for the 
platonics teams.

## Structure

### trajectories
In the folder `trajectories`, each folder represents a template for which 
recorded trajectories and skills are stored. The template is stored in the
subfolder `template`.

### execution data
In the folder `execution_data`, each pickled file contains the execution data,
a time series, including the pose, goal-pose, joint position and wrenches for
each time step recorded at 20Hz.
